Weapons tagged with this have a chance to overheat, injuring the user, when fired - Only possible thanks to fyarn and Darque as rthis has been updated to work like his jamming mechanic + damage

Warp Rift:
The Eldar Wraithcannon is a unique weapon that has a chance to totally destroy its target and damage all surronding

Baleful Energies:
Necron weaponry utilizes dangerous and baleful energies which have negative effects on living tissue, making using this technology hazardous to living beings, however they do have a chance of ignoring all armour
